# Handling Malware Incidents

## Symptoms
- Systems exhibit unusual or degraded behavior
- Unexpected processes or services are running
- Antivirus or security tools generate malware alerts
- Files are modified, encrypted, or deleted without authorization
- Network traffic shows abnormal patterns or connections

## Root Cause
- Malware introduced through phishing emails or malicious attachments
- Compromised credentials used to deploy malicious software
- Vulnerable or unpatched systems exploited by attackers
- Unauthorized software installations on managed systems

## Resolution Steps
1. Identify affected systems and confirm malware indicators
2. Isolate impacted systems from the network to prevent spread
3. Preserve logs and evidence for further analysis if required
4. Remove malware using approved security or remediation tools
5. Apply required patches or configuration changes to close vulnerabilities
6. Restore systems from trusted backups if integrity is compromised
7. Monitor systems after recovery to confirm normal operation

## Best Practices
- Keep operating systems and applications up to date with security patches
- Enforce least-privilege access for users and services
- Educate users on phishing and safe email practices
- Maintain regular backups and test restoration procedures
- Continuously monitor systems for indicators of compromise
